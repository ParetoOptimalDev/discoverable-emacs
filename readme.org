emacs distribution aimed at discoverability and lowering the bar to effectively using and extending emacs for newer users.

Requires emacs 29+

Usage:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/ParetoOptimalDev/discoverable-emacs.git
cd discoverable-emacs
emacs --init-directory=.
#+end_src

Feel free to tryout the [nix version branch](https://github.com/ParetoOptimalDev/discoverable-emacs/tree/nix-version) if you don't  already have emacs installed.

NOTE: adding new packages requires restarting emacs with the nix-version for now.
